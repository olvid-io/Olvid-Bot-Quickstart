# ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

The following best practices should be implemented based on your specific requirements once your bot has been fully developed and is ready for deployment.

If you come from [](/quickstart.md) section you set up a development environment with a daemon running locally with exposed ports, a manually started bot, ...
When your bot is ready to be passed into production there are different steps you will need to implements, depending on your use case.
You might have a look to the following sections and select which one is relevant for your use case.

:::{danger}
Before proceeding with your reading, please carefully consider the following points.

- The {term}`daemon` is an extremely sensitive entity that can access and/or store the content of your exchanges, attachments, etc. Ensure that its accesses and hosting are properly secured.
- Traffic between your bot and the daemon is not encrypted if you did not set up [TLS](#setup-tls). It should never be exposed under any circumstances.
- Similarly, without [TLS](#setup-tls), the concept of a {term}`client key` only serves to compartment usage and cannot be used for authentication purposes in any way.

## Create a Bot in Keycloak

:::{note}
This section is only for people with an Olvid Keycloak deployed 😬.

If you're unsure about what this means, don't hesitate to click 👉️ [here](https://www.olvid.io/faq/olvid-management-console) 👈️ to learn more about this premium feature !
:::

Setting up a Keycloak Bot enables you to manage it as one of your standard Keycloak users.
It can be added and removed from groups, and users can interact with the bot through the directory tab in their application.
This significantly facilitates its integration and utilization at medium and large scales.

The following steps requires access to the Olvid Management Console within your Keycloak.

### Enable bots in keycloak

:::{tip}
This step is only necessary for your first bot.
:::

For your realm if you cannot see the `Bots` button in the left sidebar, click on your realm `Settings` button.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card::

        Bot button
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-bot-button.png
            :alt: Bot settings button in keycloak administration console

    .. grid-item-card::

        Realm Settings button
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-settings-button.png
            :alt: Realm settings button in keycloak administration console
```

Then, in your realm settings switch on `Enable Bots` option.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card::

        Enable bots
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-enable-bot-switch.png
            :alt: Customizable settings section in your realm settings page.
```

### Create a new Keycloak Bot

Go to your Realm `Bots` page. The button is in the left sidepanel.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card::

        Bots button
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-bot-button.png
            :alt: Bot settings button in keycloak administration console
```

When in your Bots Management Page, click on the `Create Bot` button in the upper-left corner.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card::

        Bot Management Page
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-bots-management-page.png
            :alt: Bots management page in your keycload administration console.
```

This will show you a form to fill with your new bot username and {term}`identity details`.

```{eval-rst}
.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card::

        Bot Creation Form
        ^^^

        .. image:: _static/images/keycloak-bot-creation-form.png
            :alt: the form to create a new bot in your keycloak administration console.
```

When you validated the form a configuration link (starting with `https://configuration.olvid.io/#`) will be shown. Save this link for the next steps.

:::{tip}
If you lost your configuration link you can reset it with the refresh button in your bots list.
:::

### Create your bot identity

When you have your configuration link you will need to use CLI. Click [here](/cli/cli.md)` if you don't remember how to use it.

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :octicon:`command-palette;1em` Create a new keycloak identity
    :open:

    Start CLI, and create your new identity using your configuratin link. It will automatically generate a :term:`client key` to pass to your future bot.

    .. code-block:: sh

        # create your identity
        0 > identity kc new https://configuration.olvid.io/#AAAAAAAAA.....
        # a client key is automatically created
        identity creation > Here is your client key to connect to daemon with this identity: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        # save your client key and say yes to finish
        identity creation > Did you saved your client key ? (y/N)
        > yes
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :octicon:`command-palette;1em` Bind an existing keycloak identity to a keycloak

    If you already have an identity to your bot you can use the ``identity kc bind`` command to link it to your new Keycloak bot.

    It will register your bot on keycloak, and update it's :term:`Identity Details` to feat the details you just set up in Keycloak.

    Start CLI, choose your current identity (probably 1 if you only have one identity on your daemon), then bind it to keycloak using your configuration link

    .. code-block:: sh

        1 > identity current 1
        1 > identity kc bind https://configuration.olvid.io/#AAAAAAAAA.....

```

Every Keycloak user can now discover and interact with your bot through their `Directory` within the Olvid application.
You can also manage your bot from your Administration Console! 🎉

______________________________________________________________________

## Containerize Bot

When developing and testing your application, it's usually more convenient to use your local Python installation and a daemon container exposed to your host system.
However, for a stable environment in production, we recommend to containerize your bot application.

There are three ways to achieve this:

- [](#run-with-python-runner): Use [python-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/olvid/bot-python-runner) docker image to run your code. (fastest)
- [](#build-with-python-runner): Build a docker image from [python-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/olvid/bot-python-runner). (easier to package and distribute)
- Build your own docker image from scratch. Manually manage your code and dependencies (not detailed here).

### Run with python-runner

To start with our [python-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/olvid/bot-python-runner) docker image is the fastest way to run you bot code in a container.

You can find this image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/olvid/bot-python-runner)

This image embeds our Python module and is set up to install your code dependencies and run your bot code.

We will mount our code as a volume, and the image will manage dependencies and run our bot for us.
You just need to put your code in a directory named `app`.
You can put as may as file as you want, but your program will be launched using `python3 main.py` command.

If you need extra Python dependencies (other than the `olvid-bot` module) add a `requirements.txt` file next to you `main.py`.
Command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` will run automatically on container start.

Here is an example of file structure:

```
bot-project
|── docker-compose.yaml
|── app
| |── main.py
| |── requirements.txt
```

And here is a `docker-compose.yaml` file example, embedding a daemon, your bot and a cli to configure your daemon if necessary.

```yaml
services:
  daemon:
    image: olvid/bot-daemon
    environment:
      # TODO generate a random client key with `uuidgen` command and set it here and in the cli service
      - OLVID_ADMIN_CLIENT_KEY_CLI=SetARandomValue
    volumes:
      - ./data:/daemon/data
      - ./backups:/daemon/backups
    restart: unless-stopped

  bot:
    image: olvid/bot-python-runner
    environment:
      # TODO set OLVID_CLIENT_KEY with the client generated when creating identity on daemon
      - OLVID_CLIENT_KEY=SetMe
      - OLVID_DAEMON_TARGET=daemon:50051
    volumes:
      # you can remove :ro (read-only file system) if necessary (for example if you store files or database in working directory)
      - ./app:/app:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - daemon

  cli:
    image: olvid/bot-python-runner
    environment:
      # TODO use the same value as in the daemon OLVID_ADMIN_CLIENT_KEY_CLI
      - OLVID_ADMIN_CLIENT_KEY=SetARandomValue
      - OLVID_DAEMON_TARGET=daemon:50051
    entrypoint: "olvid-cli"
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    # share a volume where you can put photos to set up identity profile photos
    volumes:
      - ./photos:/photos
    depends_on:
      - daemon
    # You may use a profile as the CLI only needs to be started manually
    profiles:
      - "cli"
```

:::{note}
We do not need to expose daemon ports because every other services will connect to daemon inside docker network.
:::

If this is the first time you launch your daemon you can use {term}`CLI` to configure your daemon.

To launch CLI use:

```sh
docker compose run --rm -it cli
```

You will enter CLI interactive mode and you can now follow [](/quickstart.md#initialize-daemon) procedure to create your bot identity, and retrieve it's client key.

When you have your bot client key you can set it as OLVID_CLIENT_KEY value in bot service environment.

Create a directory named `app` and move your `main.py` and eventually your `requirements.txt` files inside.

You can now start your bot with:

```sh
docker compose up -d bot
```

If you need to check logs use:

```sh
docker compose logs -f daemon
# or
docker compose logs -f bot
```

### Build with python-runner

Building your own docker image allows you to push it to a registry, making it easy to deploy your bot on one or multiple remote machines.

Here is an example of a `Dockerfile`.

```Dockerfile
# build from our python-runner image (image version is the same as installed olvid-bot module)
FROM olvid/bot-python-runner:latest

# un-comment to install any python package you need
# RUN pip3 install python-package

COPY ./app /app
```

To build your image run:

```sh
docker build -t my-first-bot .
```

If you want to test your image locally you can use `docker run` command.
We suppose you have a listening {term}`daemon` and an associated {term}`client key`.

Mind to replace my-olvid-client-key and your_host_address with your client key, and your local ip address.

```sh
docker run --rm -e OlVID_CLIENT_KEY=my-olvid-client-key \
    -e OLVID_DAEMON_TARGET=your_host_address:50051 \
    --network host \
    my-first-bot
```

## Setup TLS


:::{versionadded} 1.0.1
:::

gRPC natively support TLS. We can distinguish two modes:

- [](#tls-server-authentication): The daemon starts with its own self-signed certificate and associated private key. Clients will use this certificate to encrypt communications with the daemon.
- [](#tls-with-client-authentication): We create our own Certification Authority (CA) to create certificates.
We will then create a certificate and a private key for the daemon and one per client.
Like this, clients can encrypt communications with the daemon, and the daemon can verify that clients have been authorized to connect.

### TLS Server authentication

#### Generating Server Certificate and Private Key using OpenSSL

:::{warning}
{material-outlined}`warning;1em;sd-text-danger` **Important**: Replace `localhost` with your daemon's hostname. The hostname is the IP address or domain name that clients will use to establish a connection with the daemon.
:::

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key \
    -days 36500 -out server.pem -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
```

Here is a rewritten version with corrected English and improved clarity:

#### Set up daemon

Pass certificate and private key to daemon using environment variables:

- `DAEMON_CERTIFICATE_FILE`
- `DAEMON_KEY_FILE`

If you use docker, create a credentials directory, containing previously generated certificate and key.
Add this directory as a read-only volume and use environment variable to enable simple TLS in daemon.

If you are using Docker, create a credentials directory containing the previously generated certificate and key.
Mount this directory as a read-only volume and utilize environment variables to enable TLS server authentication in the daemon.

```yaml
daemon:
  image: olvid/bot-daemon:latest
  environment:
    - OLVID_ADMIN_CLIENT_KEY_CLI=ToSet
    - DAEMON_CERTIFICATE_FILE=./credentials/server.pem
    - DAEMON_KEY_FILE=./credentials/server.key
  ports:
    - 50051:50051
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - ./data:/daemon/data
    - ./backups:/daemon/backups
    - ./credentials:/daemon/credentials:ro
```

#### Setting up bot

To ensure communication encryption, your bot needs the daemon certificate.

Let's assume you have a `credentials` directory containing the previously generated `server.pem` file.
If you're running in a Docker environment, you can mount this directory as a read-only volume.

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using environment (for docker containers)
    :open:

    Set up environment variables.

    .. code-block:: sh

        export OLVID_SERVER_CERTIFICATE_PATH=./credentials/server.pem

    Now ``OlvidClient`` sub-classes will automatically enable TLS server authentication on start.

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio
        from olvid import OlvidClient

        async def main():
            # Implicit configuration, this automatically load configuration from environment
            client = OlvidClient()
            print(await client.identity_get())
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using Files (for dev environment only)
    :open:

    OlvidClient can search for specific file names to load TLS configurations. For a persistent TLS configuration (compared to using environment variables), you can create symlinks or copy files to specific locations.

    .. code-block:: sh

        ln -s ./credentials/server.pem .server.pem

    Now ``OlvidClient`` sub-classes will automatically enable TLS server authentication on start.

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio
        from olvid import OlvidClient

        async def main():
            # Implicit configuration, this automatically load configuration from environment or .server.pem file
            client = OlvidClient()
            print(await client.identity_get())
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using Code

    Create a `GrpcSimpleTlsConfiguration` object and pass it as tls_configuration parameter to an `OlvidClient` subclass constructor.

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio
        from olvid import OlvidClient

        async def main():
            client = OlvidClient(tls_configuration=OlvidClient.GrpcSimpleTlsConfiguration(
                    server_certificate_path="./credentials/server.pem"
            ))
            print(await client.identity_get())

		asyncio.set_event_loop(asyncio.new_event_loop())
		asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

### TLS with Client authentication

#### Generating Certificates

We recommend that you create a `credentials` directory and moved in to run every following commands.

:::{note}
To generate CA and server certificate you will need these two openssl templates, download or create them in your current working directory.

- {download}`ca-openssl.cnf <_static/code/ca-openssl.cnf>`
- {download}`server-openssl.cnf <_static/code/server-openssl.cnf>`

% todo: replace by a link to a github repository or to an example directory ?
:::

```{eval-rst}
.. card::

    **Generate our local Certification Authority (CA)**
    ^^^

    .. code-block:: sh

        # You can leave input default values
        openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -out ca.pem \
          -config ca-openssl.cnf -days 36500 -extensions v3_req
```

```{eval-rst}

    .. code-block:: sh

        # generate client key
        openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out client.key

        # generate client certificate request (you can leave default value)
        openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
        # set common name to whatever you want that will identify client
        openssl x509 -req -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -in client.csr \
          -out client.pem -days 36500
```

#### Set up daemon

Daemon will need its certificate, its private key, and the CA to check client are allowed to connect.
We will use three environment variables to specify file paths:

- `DAEMON_CERTIFICATE_FILE`
- `DAEMON_KEY_FILE`
- `DAEMON_ROOT_CERTIFICATE_FILE`

Create a `credentials` directory, `ca.pem`, `server.pem` and `server.key` files.

Add this `credentials` directory as a read-only volume and use environment variable to enable TLS with client authentication in daemon.

```yaml
daemon:
  image: olvid/bot-daemon
  environment:
    - OLVID_ADMIN_CLIENT_KEY_CLI=ToSet
    - DAEMON_CERTIFICATE_FILE=./credentials/server.pem
    - DAEMON_KEY_FILE=./credentials/server.key
    - DAEMON_ROOT_CERTIFICATE_FILE=./credentials/ca.pem
  ports:
    - 50051:50051
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - ./data:/daemon/data
    - ./backups:/daemon/backups
    - ./credentials:/daemon/credentials:ro
```

#### Setting up bot

Your bots will need a valid certificate and private key pair, and the CA certificate.
If you followed Generating Certificates section you will need `client.pem`, `client.key` and `ca.pem` files.

If you are in docker you can mount `credentials` directory as a read-only volume.

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using environment (for docker containers)
    :open:

    Set up three environment variables.

    .. code-block:: sh

        export OLVID_ROOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH=./credientials/ca.pem
        export OLVID_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_PATH=./credientials/client.pem
        export OLVID_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./credientials/client.key
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using files (for development environment)
    :open:

    On start OlvidClient can look for some specific files names to load a tls configuration. To have a persistent TLS configuration (compared to environment), you can create symlinks or copy files to specific locations.

    .. code-block:: sh

        ln -s ./credentials/ca.pem .ca.pem
        ln -s ./credentials/client.pem .client.pem
        ln -s ./credentials/client.key .client.key
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :material-regular:`settings;1em` Using Code

    Create a `GrpcMutualAuthTlsConfiguration` object and pass it as tls_configuration parameter to an `OlvidClient` subclass constructor.

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio
        from olvid import OlvidClient

        async def main():
            client = OlvidClient(tls_configuration=OlvidClient.GrpcMutualAuthTlsConfiguration(
                    root_certificate_path="./credentials/ca.pem",
                    certificate_chain_path="./credentials/client.pem",
                    private_key_path="./credentials/client.key"
            ))
            print(await client.identity_get())

        asyncio.set_event_loop(asyncio.new_event_loop())
		asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Backups

In your projects, the daemon is a central element and it's where the data are stored.
In reality, the data you manipulate (identities, messages, ...) is only a tiny part of the data that the daemon manage.
It's this invisible data that needs to be saved, as it enables secure exchange with the bot's contacts.

### Warnings

:::{danger}
Please carefully review the following recommendations and warnings before continuing.

- Backups contain sensitive data equivalent to the daemon's data directory. It is imperative to handle them with the same rigor and level of security.
- Backups mentioned here are Olvid backups, which do not contain messages or attachments. These backups allow you to restore your contact book and groups, but not the discussion content.
- Backups are ... backups. You will have to save them in a safe place to be able to re-use them if necessary. In a production environment, the minimal best practice would be to store backups on a separate disk from the rest of the system.
- Restoring a backup on another daemon and running both simultaneously will lead to unpredictable behavior.
:::

### Setup automatic backups

Daemon automatically and periodically creates backup. Backups are created every time it's necessary (your  bot added a contact, joined or left a group, ...).
These backups are stored in `/daemon/backups` directory.

If you want to persist these backups you need to mount the `/daemon/backups` directory as a volume. Here is an example in a `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```sh
services:
  daemon:
    image: olvid/bot-daemon
    volumes:
      - ./data:/daemon/data
      - ./backups:/daemon/backups
```

Here is an example of `/daemon/backups` directory tree.

```
| backups
|  | 0001
|  |  | backup-1041588600.bytes
|  |  | backup-1569233400.bytes
|  |  | backup_seed.txt
```

Each subdirectory (0001, 0002) must contains it's own `backup_seed.txt` file daemon will increment and create a new directory.
This backup seed is necessary to decrypt and restore backups, without the seed your backup is unusable.

Inside a subdirectory the daemon create and stores up to 10 backup files before rotating them. All these backups are named with their creation epoch timestamp.

### Restore a backup

:::{danger}
Restoring a backup is not a trivial action and should only be done as a last resort.
You will lose all your stored messages and attachments in the daemon during this process.
Only elements saved using the storage API will still be available.
:::

To restore a backup you will need a fresh daemon installation.
If you want to reset an existing daemon delete the `data` folder content (this data is probably mounted as a volume on host system).

Daemon will also need to access backup files, so we will need another volume.

```yaml
services:
  daemon:
    image: olvid/bot-daemon
    volumes:
      # data directory must be empty
      - ./data:/daemon/data
      # mount your backups directory to let daemon use them
      - ./backups:/daemon/backups
```

Then choose the backup to restore in your backups (it's most of the time the most recent). Save the subdirectory and backup file name for later.

Now we will need to start daemon in a recovery mode and tell him to restore our backup.
There are two solutions, we can use `docker compose` or `docker run`.

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :octicon:`command-palette;1em` docker compose
    :open:

    With docker compose you can reuse your current docker-compose.yaml file by verifying beforehand that:

    * The data volume has been properly cleared.
    * Backup directory has been mounted to /daemon/backups.
    * All other running services have been stopped using the command docker-compose down.

    Then you can start backup restoration with the following command.
    Do not forget to replace the backup subdirectory (0001) and filename (backup-1569233400.bytes) with your own values.

    .. code-block:: sh

        docker compose run --rm daemon \
            -r backups/0001/backup-1569233400.bytes | grep Backup
```

```{eval-rst}
.. dropdown:: :octicon:`command-palette;1em` docker run

    First check that your original daemon is not running and the data directory you will mount is empty.

    Here is an example of ``docker run`` command to adapt to your situation.
    Mind to check the volume location on host system, daemon image version, your backup subdirectory and file name.

    .. code-block:: sh

        docker run --rm \
            -v ./data:/daemon/data \
            -v ./backups:/daemon/backups \
            olvid/bot-daemon -r backups/0001/backup-1569233400.bytes | grep Backup
```

When you see the message `💾 BackupRestoration: Finished backup restoration process`, you can stop the daemon (CTRL + C) and start it normally with the command `docker-compose up -d`.

You can now verify using the CLI that the restoration was successful. You should find your identities, contacts, groups, client keys, ...

```{eval-rst}
.. todo:: add something about storage API
```
